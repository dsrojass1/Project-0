# Project 0 DAVID SAMUEL ROJAS SANCHEZ 202214621
The task of this project is to use Python or Java to implement a simple yes/no parser. The program should read a text file that contains a program for the robot, and verify whether the syntax is correct. 
## Instructions to use the parser:
1. The logic of the parser is on ......robotObstacles\source\uniandes\lym\robot\control\Parser
2. The logic of the tokenizer is on ......robotObstacles\source\uniandes\lym\robot\control\Tokenizador
3. For executing the parser run 'EjecutarParser' that is on ......robotObstacles\source\uniandes\lym\robot\view\EjectuarParser
4. The program will ask you to put the name of the .txt file as input. Please do not forget to type the extension .txt (IMPORTANT: The text file must be on the folder 'doc' that is on ........Project 0\robotObstacles\doc 
5. After the given input in the console will be shown: 1. The text file 2. The recognized tokens ennumerated from 0 (The ennumeration does not belong to the line in text file) 3. If the text file does not contain syntax errors 'Syntax is correct :)', -Exception otherwise.
