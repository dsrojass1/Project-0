# Project 0 DAVID SAMUEL ROJAS SANCHEZ 202214621
The task of this project is to use Python or Java to implement a simple yes/no parser. The program should read a text file that contains a program for the robot, and verify whether the syntax is correct. 
## Instructions to use the parser:
1. The logic of the parser is on ......robotObstacles\source\uniandes\lym\robot\control\Parser
2. The logic of the tokenizer is on ......robotObstacles\source\uniandes\lym\robot\control\Tokenizador
3. For executing the parser run 'EjecutarParser' that is on ......robotObstacles\source\uniandes\lym\robot\view\EjectuarParser
4. The program will ask you to put the name of the .txt file as input. Please do not forget to type the extension .txt (IMPORTANT: The text file must be on the folder 'doc' that is on ........Project 0\robotObstacles\doc 
5. After the given input in the console will be shown: 1. The text file 2. The recognized tokens ennumerated from 0 (The ennumeration does not belong to the line in text file) 3. If the text file does not contain syntax errors 'Syntax is correct :)', -Exception otherwise.

## ATTENTION
The grammar which the language and the parser follows is the GRAMMAR.pdf file right above README.md
Please check the grammar since it is the most important task of the project.
Furthermore, please be aware of the errors that could be on the examples for grading the projects. I did my best to understand the requirements and sense of the language since there are many typos and inconsistencies in the guide pdf. The examples given as input may not be the exception. Lastly, it is important to notice the last commit on this repository since I created it as a public one. I hope that the last commit date on this repository is evidence in case of any similarity with someone else's code.
